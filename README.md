Customer Churn Prediction
This project aims to predict customer churn in a business context using machine learning. The project analyzes customer data, explores various predictive models, and selects the best one to help businesses proactively address potential customer loss.

Project Overview
The dataset used in this project includes features related to customer behaviors and demographics. The goal is to identify customers who are at risk of churning, enabling targeted retention efforts.

Notebook Structure
Importing Libraries:
The notebook employs common libraries including:

numpy, pandas: For data manipulation and analysis
seaborn, matplotlib: For visualizations
scikit-learn: For building and evaluating machine learning models
Loading and Exploring the Data:
The dataset is loaded and examined to understand its structure and identify potential data quality issues.

Data Preprocessing:

Address missing values and data types.
Encode categorical features to make the data suitable for modeling.
Scale numerical data to enhance model performance.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualize customer demographics, behaviors, and their correlations with churn.
Understand key factors influencing customer churn.
Feature Selection:

Use feature selection techniques like Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) to identify impactful features.
Feature selection helps improve model performance by focusing on relevant data attributes.
Model Training and Comparison:

Train several machine learning models, including:
Logistic Regression
Random Forest Classifier
Gradient Boosting Classifier
Perform hyperparameter tuning to optimize model accuracy and effectiveness.
Model Evaluation:

Evaluate models using metrics such as:
Accuracy
Precision
Recall
F1-score
The best-performing model is selected based on its overall performance and business value.
Results
The project successfully identifies key indicators of customer churn, with the best model achieving high predictive accuracy. This enables effective segmentation and targeting of high-risk customers for retention efforts.
